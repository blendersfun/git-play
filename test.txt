This is a test file. Sweet! Sweet! Awesome!
    Some things might be here. On the other hand, they might not be.
  One of the issues involving with test files in version controll is
  there is no rationale why I would be versioning this.
I will speak ideas.
That is all.
  Why do I care what was added or deleted? Or even modified?
  (please do not yell in here.)
  Would I be collaborating on this test file? When would merge
  conflicts ever occur in such a file?
Aaron: How's things?
xxDabog: Simple. Just simple.
Aaron: Excellent, just what I was hoping you'd say.

I'm starting a whole new section. Oh, you are, are you?
