This is a test file.
    Some things might be here. On the other hand, they might not be.
  The problem with test files in version controll is
  there is no rationale why I would be versioning this.
I will say words.
That is all.
  I mean, why do I care what was added or deleted? Or even modified?
  (please do not yell in here.)
  Would I be collaborating on this test file? When would merge
  conflicts ever occur in such a file?
